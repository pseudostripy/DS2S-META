# DS2S META
 Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin testing/debugging/practice tool  
 Based on a CE table by [Lord Radai](https://github.com/LordRadai)  
 
 Inspired by [DS-Gadget 3.0](https://github.com/JKAnderson/DS-Gadget) and uses [Property Hook](https://github.com/JKAnderson/PropertyHook) by [TKGP](https://github.com/JKAnderson/).  
 
 META stands for:  
M  
E  
T  
A

 There has been absolutely NO testing on this tool and online use. For offline use only. Use online at your own risk.  
 Even actions not locked behind a setting are considered unsafe for online use.  
 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED  

## Requirements 
* General support for SotFS/Vanilla: [.NET 8 for x64] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  
* Speedhack support for Vanilla: [.NET 8 for x86] see above link and select x86. If you attempt to use SpeedHack in Vanilla without this, META will silently crash.

## Installing  
* Extract contents of zip archive to it's own folder. 
* Open DS2 META.exe and let Windows scan it if it needs to.
* Ensure Windows defender or your antivirus didn't quarantine the program.
